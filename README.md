# Toycathon-Kodesplash

This project was built for Toycathon 2021 by a team of 5. It qualified for the Grand Finale.

**What is Kodesplash?**

	Kodesplash is a collection of many games where Each Java concept is taught through a separate unique game inspired by Indian Culture and heritage
	We first give players an introduction(syntax and a basic understanding) to the coding concept dedicated to that level
	Then we give them the rules to the game
	Kodesplash focuses on the Gamified learning of Java

**The game:**

	Pieces of incomplete code are given which the player will have to complete based on the specifications of the game environment 
	If an incorrect option is chosen, a brief audio clip explanation plays
	When the player clicks on the correct button, the game animation will take place.
		
**Representation of Indian Culture:**

	10 unique mini-games with multiple levels based on different States of India 
	Inspired by modern India- eg., Atal Tunnel, Himachal Pradesh;
	Depicts Indian Culture- eg., Makar Sankranti, Gujarat;
	Spreads awareness on national Missions- eg., Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, Madhya Pradesh;
	Celebrates Indiaâ€™s heroes and pioneers- 
	eg., 
		Ajit Doval(National Security Advisor of India), Uttarakhand;
		Mary Kom(Boxing Champion), Manipur;
		Brijmohan Lal Munjal(founder of Hero cycles), Punjab;
		Vishwanathan Anand(Chess Legend), Tamil Nadu;

	Kodesplash is Age independent
	Inclusive (towards the hearing impaired)
	Online learning is becoming increasingly popular
	Java is the most popular programming language in the world
	Java is well accepted world over
	Java is the future

**Future scope for Kodesplash:**

	Can easily be made a mobile app by changing the alignment of each scene
	Scope to teach more programming languages and also AI, ML based coding
